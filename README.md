**This document is prepared to guide the installation of Zephyr for the STM32MP1 board. Note that no officially detailed board support has been released by Zephyr for this board.**
**Prepared based on Need.**

**This document explains how to initialize a new Zephyr project structure from scratch. Later, we will build a sample application provided by Zephyr and load it onto the board.**

The required steps mostly consist of the following:

0.  Repository cannot be build and run without completing below steps.  
    Clone it and delete everythink except readme.md & Stm32mp1_Zephyr_Config_Flash_2.pdf & 
Stm32mp1_Zephyr_Project_Creation_Guide.pdf 

2.  Setting up the virtual environment and installing required packages
    
3.  Cloning and updating the Zephyr repository using the West tool
    
4.  Building the project
